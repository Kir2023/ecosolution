                  Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity through
                  different mechanisms. Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy
                  of the wind to turn blades, which then drive a generator.
                  Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through the
                  photovoltaic effect. When integrated into a renewable energy
                  system, these technologies complement each other by providing
                  a continuous and reliable power supply. Wind power is often
                  more abundant during certain times, while solar power is
                  consistent during daylight hours, resulting in a more stable
                  overall energy output.
